# zoa-image-classifier
Zoanthids, commonly referred to as Zoas, are a popular type of soft coral in the saltwater aquarium industry that come in a wide variety of colors and patterns. The industry collectively assigns fun and silly common names to popular strains for easier communication and marketing hype.

It can be difficult to correctly identify an unknown Zoa because there are so many different variations that exist, and some look very similar to each other with subtle differences. Also, good luck if you're like me and have some form of color vision deficiency. Classifying Zoas seems like a suitable candidate for a multi-class image classifier.
